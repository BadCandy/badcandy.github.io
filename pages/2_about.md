### About comments
Add a variable called `comments` to the [YAML front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and set its value to true. A sample might look like:

    layout: default
    comments: true
    # other options

In between a `{% if page.comments %}` and a `{% endif %}` tag, add the Universal Embed Code in the appropriate template where you'd like Disqus or Duoshuo to load.
